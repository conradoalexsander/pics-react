This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Pics -  A galery App (React, CSS Grid, Axios and Unsplash api)

Hello,

This app was created to study a little bit more about CSS Grid and how to render diferent sizes images in a better way. Just type a subject in the search bar and hit enter, so the images from Unsplash API will be rendered in the page. 

PS.: You need an Unsplash API key to use and test the app, you can get more info about it here: https://unsplash.com/developers
